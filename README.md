#PressXO WooCommerce Code Snippets
This repo contains useful WooCommerce code snippets we've collected while working on various ecommerce projects. Most of these come from real client work where we needed to customize WooCommerce behavior or fix specific issues. Instead of searching through old projects every time, we decided to keep everything organized here.
You'll find snippets for common tasks like customizing checkout fields, modifying product displays, handling custom shipping calculations, and integrating with third-party services. All code is tested and comes with basic usage instructions. Feel free to use, modify, or contribute your own snippets. If something doesn't work for your setup, open an issue and we'll try to help out.
